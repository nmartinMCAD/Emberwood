        <h2>Fires on the Rise</h2>
        <p>Unlike most natural disasters, wildfires, also known as forest or wildland fires, are primarily caused by people.
        Recently, wildfires have become increasingly more frequent, burning <span class="copyEmphasize">9 million acres
        of land</span> in the United States each year. This is nearly double the historical yearly average.</p>

        <p>While humans may be the direct cause of the majority of these fires, certain environmental conditions contribute to a fire’s
        ability to spread quickly, consuming <span class="copyEmphasize">everything and everyone in its path.</span> This includes extreme
        drought and heat, which create conditions that encourage the spread of wildfires.</p>

        <p>For these reasons, <span class="copyEmphasize">great responsibility must be taken</span> when being active in the wilderness. Exercising an awareness of
        the environment, and following the local rules and regulations helps to prevent wildfires, so they do not
        begin, and become a threat to people and their property.</p>

        <h2>Emberwood</h2>
        <p>Emberwood is an <span class="copyEmphasize">online, interactive experience</span> that puts you in the boots of a wildland firefighter,
        working to extinguish a raging fire tearing across the wilderness. As the fire continues to grow fiercer and more intense,
        your job is to use your wit as well as resources to <span class="copyEmphasize">contain the violent inferno</span> and ensure that it doesn’t spread.
        It’s a race against the clock to save as much of the forest as you can, and along the way, come to understad
        the destructive capabilites of wildland fires and the extreme dangers they often present.</p>
